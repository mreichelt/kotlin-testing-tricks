# Testing Tricks with Kotlin

A talk for [Droidcon Berlin 2024](https://berlin.droidcon.com/speaker/marc-reichelt/), on July 3rd at 4:20 PM in room 'Things'.

Level up your testing skills! A strong type safety is a great first defence against bugs. Beyond that, unit tests allow us to catch bugs early in development, and ensure our project will be maintainable in the long run. Also, tests are fun!

In this live-coding session, we'll have a look at lots of tricks across the board: How to use Kotlin for our testing advantage, how to keep tests blazingly fast, which great reasons are there to avoid use of mocks, how to find very tricky issues like memory leaks and multiple TestScopes when testing Coroutines, how to test Android APIs, screenshot testing, and much more!
